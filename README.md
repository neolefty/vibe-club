# Snake Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library.

## Features

*   **Player-controlled snake:** Use the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen.
*   **Food consumption:** Guide the snake to the red food circles. When the snake eats, it grows longer.
*   **Score tracking:** The score increases each time the snake eats a piece of food.
*   **Game-over conditions:** The game ends if the snake runs into the edge of the screen or collides with its own body.

## How to Run

To play the game, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed, then run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python snake_game.py
```
