# Gemini Games

This project contains two classic games: a web-based Tower Defense game and a Python-based Snake game.

## Tower Defense

This is a simple tower defense game that runs in the browser.

### How to Run

To play the game, open the `tower-defense/index.html` file in your web browser.

## Snake Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library.

### Features

*   **Player-controlled snake:** Use the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen.
*   **Food consumption:** Guide the snake to the red food circles. When the snake eats, it grows longer.
*   **Score tracking:** The score increases each time the snake eats a piece of food.
*   **Game-over conditions:** The game ends if the snake runs into the edge of the screen or collides with its own body.

### How to Run

To play the game, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed, then run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python snake-game/snake_game.py
```
